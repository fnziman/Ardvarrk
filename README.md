### Lifehacking New Jersey Transit

In Penn Station, NY,  you constantly have to wait for your platform to be
announced before going downstairs to the platform.
There is then a mad rush as people shove each other to get downstairs.

Ardvarrk will scrape data from the NJT Departure Vision page and eventually, will
do predictive modeling on that data in order to guess which platform your train
will come in on.

I also intend to add a UI so that users can add their phone numbers, and trains
they would like to be alerted for, so that the system can send a text message with
the boarding platform as soon as it is announced.
